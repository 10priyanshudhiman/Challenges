While William Shakespeare's reputation is based primarily on his plays, he became famous first as a poet. 
With the partial exception of the Sonnets (1609), quarried since the early 19th century for autobiographical 
secrets allegedly encoded in them, the nondramatic writings have traditionally been pushed to the margins of 
the Shakespeare industry. Yet the study of his nondramatic poetry can illuminate Shakespeare’s activities as 
a poet emphatically of his own age, especially in the period of extraordinary literary ferment in the last ten 
or twelve years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
Shakespeare’s exact birth date remains unknown. He was baptized in Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon 
on April 26, 1564, his mother's third child, but the first to survive infancy. This has led scholars to conjecture 
that he was born on April 23rd, given the era's convention of baptizing newborns on their third day. Shakespeare’s 
father, John Shakespeare, moved to Stratford in about 1552 and rapidly became a prominent figure in the town’s business 
and politics. He rose to be bailiff, the highest official in the town, but then in about 1575-1576 his prosperity declined 
markedly and he withdrew from public life. In 1596, thanks to his son’s success and persistence, he was granted a coat of arms 
by the College of Arms, and the family moved into New Place, the grandest house in Stratford.
Speculation that William Shakespeare traveled, worked as a schoolmaster in the country, was a soldier and a law clerk, or embraced 
or left the Roman Catholic Church continues to fill the gaps left in the sparse records of the so-called lost years. 
It is conventionally assumed (though attendance registers do not survive) that Shakespeare attended the King’s New School in Stratford, 
along with others of his social class. At the age of 18, in November 1582, he married Anne Hathaway, daughter of a local farmer. 
She was pregnant with Susanna Shakespeare, who was baptized on May 26, 1583. The twins, Hamnet and Judith Shakespeare, were baptized on February 2, 1585. 
There were no further children from the union.
